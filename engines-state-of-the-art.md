### This document summarizes main features of ready-to-use chatbot engines


## What a Bot Engine wraps inside
Understanding the user intent
Decide the bot's response
Decide the bot's action
Decide if the bot ask questions

### Stories
Two schools - Rules vs Machine Learning

1. Machine learning
- problem lies in training dataset
- using a dozen examples can work well
- but for medium complexity need thousands conversations

2. Rules or imperative approach
- script or program
- good = instant demos - the bot will work
- bad = new paths -- add more rules until collapses
- the curse of combinatorics - eg. new rule conflicts with old rules
